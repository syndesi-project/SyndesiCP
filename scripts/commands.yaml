# This file describe every commands used in the Syndesi Communication Protocol (SCP)
# - Requests : host -> device
# - Replies  : device -> host
#
# Each command is used both ways (as a request, then as a reply). Therefor each command as request fields and reply fields
# The fields are described in order as such
#   request_content:        # this is an empty command
#   reply_content:        # the reply has some data
#     length:
#       size: 1
#       type: "uint"
#     name:
#       size: length
#       type: "string"
# 
# In this case, the reply contains a length variable (0-255) specifying the number of bytes in the following string
#
# SUPPORTED TYPES
#
# - "int"      signed integer
# - "uint"     unsigned interger
# - "float"    single precision (4 bytes)
# - "double"   double precision (8 bytes)
# - "byte"     used for byte arrays
# - "char"     used for strings (constant length)
# - "{A,B}"    enum (1 byte)
# 
#
#
#
# The content of each frame is specific to each command and is specified in the content array
# - i8           -> signed byte (8 bits)
# - u32          -> unsigned integer (32 bits)
# - a5           -> array of 5 bytes
# - s10          -> string of 10 bytes
#
# Heritance
#
# - length: u8   -> Length is 8 bits long (1 byte)
# - name: length -> Name is length-bytes long
#
# Note that the u8/u16/etc... are affected by endianness (big endian through the network)
# array types aren't affected and are copied "as is"
# 
# The content is described for both request and reply
