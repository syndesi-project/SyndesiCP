* DEVICE mode : can receive commands (like a IÂ²C interface, SPI interface, etc...)
*/

* Enabled callback
* #define USE_REGISTER_READ_16_REQUEST_CALLBACK

* The user must then implement it (following the prototype in callbacks.h)
*
* Each request callback follows the format :
*   command_request_callback(request, reply);
* The reply, passed as a pointer, must be editer by the user in the callback
*
* Each reply callback follows the format :
*   command_reply_callback(reply);
* No response to the device will be made
